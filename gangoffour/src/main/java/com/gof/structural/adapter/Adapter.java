 * can't because of incompatible interfaces.
 * <ol>To get different classes working together, an adapter is provided 
 * in the middle: this might mean,
 * <li>inherit both implementations of the 2 different types (the 
 * <strong>class</strong> version of the adapter pattern)</li>
 * <li>compose one instance inside the other and implement the 
 * containing object in terms of the interface of the contained object (the 
 * <strong>object</strong> version of the adapter pattern)</li>
 * </ol>
